## Recomendations

For this project, I use `npm install` & `expo install`.

You can use yarn or npm to install all the required libraries.
It is a matter of personal choice, but both have their advantages.

The `expo install` will install compatible dependencies that works with your current setup.

`npm install` will look for the latest dependency library the output might cause your App not to work properly.
